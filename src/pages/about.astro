				<p>
					Salient is a community for people who are already actively engaged with technology and want to make their work more impactful and more meaningful.
				</p>
				<p>
					We operate at the intersection of philosophy, values, and an action-driven approach. Not theory for theory's sake — but thinking that leads to building, and building that is grounded in thinking.
				</p>
				<p>
					The name comes from what we believe matters: making the important things prominent. In a world saturated with tools and possibilities, the hardest question isn't <em>what can we build</em> but <em>what should we build</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are people who want to use the power provided by today's tools for global good.
