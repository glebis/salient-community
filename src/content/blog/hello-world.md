We live in a time of extraordinary capability. The tools available to builders today are more powerful than anything that came before. And yet, the question that haunts thoughtful practitioners isn't about capability — it's about direction.

**What should we build?**

This is not a new question. But it has become urgent in a way it wasn't before. When building is fast and cheap, the constraint shifts from *can we* to *should we*. And that shift demands a different kind of thinking.

## The forgotten duty

Brendan McCord and the Cosmos Institute articulate something we feel deeply: every builder's first duty is philosophical — to decide what they should build *for*. This duty has largely been forgotten.

Silicon Valley once understood this. Jobs and Wozniak asked what kind of creative life personal computers should enable. ARPANET's pioneers envisioned what kind of connected society networks should foster. But as technology matured into industry, builders increasingly outsourced this duty to metrics, markets, and momentum.

The consequence is subtle but profound: builders inherit answers from environmental defaults rather than examined principles. Technical frameworks embed moral ones — optimization choices are normative decisions disguised as methodology.

## The philosopher-builder

We draw inspiration from what the Cosmos Institute calls the *philosopher-builder* — someone who fuses sustained inquiry with ambitious execution. Benjamin Franklin is their model: he didn't just invent things, he built institutions that embodied philosophical convictions about human flourishing. He created America's first subscription library to break knowledge monopolies. He funded printers across colonies to enable dissent. He structured philanthropic gifts to compound over centuries, betting on future generations being wiser stewards.

What distinguished Franklin wasn't genius alone — it was intellectual courage to question prevailing assumptions, moral clarity to build for human flourishing rather than mere optimization, and pioneering vision to shape futures rather than respond to them.

## Meaning through making

There's a deeper current here too. Meaning doesn't emerge from abstract thinking alone — it comes from engagement, from making, from the direct encounter between intention and material. The concept of *homo faber* — humans as makers — points to something existential: that building is itself a source of meaning, when it's grounded in purpose.

But not all building generates meaning equally. Speed without reflection produces quantity, not significance. Efficiency without values produces optimization, not flourishing. More data doesn't equal more understanding — what gets measured is not necessarily what matters.

The meaningful path requires engagement with difficulty, the development of mastery over time, and integration of craft with larger purpose.

## What we're building for

Salient exists for people who already build — and want what they build to matter. Not in the shallow sense of metrics and traction, but in the deeper sense of contributing to a world worth living in.

We believe:

- **Philosophy isn't separate from practice.** Every technical choice embeds a moral one. Make the implicit explicit.
- **Values aren't constraints on building — they're the compass.** Profitable and good products emerge from steering into human strength, not exploiting human weakness.
- **Action without reflection is just motion.** But reflection without action is just commentary.

With AI, we're creating civilization's new epistemic infrastructure — systems that don't just shape how we think, but can do the thinking for us. These tools will either expand human autonomy and enable truth-seeking, or systematically erode them. Unexamined defaults won't cut it.

Franklin faced his moment and built institutions that embodied his convictions. We face ours. What will we build for?
