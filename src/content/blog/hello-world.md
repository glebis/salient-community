We live in a time of extraordinary capability. The tools available to builders today are more powerful than anything that came before. And yet, the question that haunts thoughtful practitioners isn't about capability — it's about direction.

**What should we build?**

This is not a new question. But it has become urgent in a way it wasn't before. When building is fast and cheap, the constraint shifts from *can we* to *should we*. And that shift demands a different kind of thinking.

Salient exists for people who already build — and want what they build to matter. Not in the shallow sense of metrics and traction, but in the deeper sense of contributing to a world worth living in.

We believe philosophy isn't separate from practice. Values aren't constraints on building — they're the compass. And action without reflection is just motion.

More to come.
